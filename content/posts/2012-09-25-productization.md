On Wednesday, SuSE released a new version of their system manager based on Spacewalk 1.7+ codebase. Being Spacewalk/OpenSCAP integration architect, I was truly delighted to see that their marketing has made a major news from the OpenSCAP integration. What matters the fact, that article has contained a few minor misconceptions from a technical perspective. (I have also learned that it is not a duty of yours competitors marketing to admit which company has lead the project and contributed all of the advertised changes upstream. :-))

On Thursday, Red Hat released Red Hat Network Satellite 5.5 which has OpenSCAP integrated as well, with a few features above the rival.

No matter which product do you choose, since Thursday you can enjoy [documentation](https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Network_Satellite/5.5/html/User_Guide/chap-Red_Hat_Network_Satellite-User_Guide-OpenSCAP.html).
